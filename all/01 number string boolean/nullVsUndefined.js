//Interview questions
// Difference between null vs undefined
// Simply put, undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. ... 
// On the other hand, null is an object. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value.


//For Null
 var iAmUseless = null;
 console.log(iAmUseless);
 console.log(typeof(iAmUseless));


// For undefined
var  iAmStandBy;
console.log(iAmStandBy);
console.log(typeof(iAmStandBy));
